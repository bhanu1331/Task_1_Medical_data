Data Cleaning and Preprocessing 

Addressed Missing Values
Identified empty or blank cells in columns like Age and Gender using Excel filters. Filled in missing information where possible or flagged/removed incomplete entries.

Eliminated Duplicate Records
Applied Excel’s “Remove Duplicates” tool to retain only unique rows, ensuring no repeated patient entries.

Standardized Text Entries
Standardized Gender values to M and F and trimmed extra spaces in Neighbourhood names for consistency.

Unified Date Formats
Converted ScheduledDay and AppointmentDay to a consistent dd-mm-yyyy format for easier analysis.

Cleaned Column Names
Renamed headers to uniform lowercase names with underscores (e.g., ScheduledDay → scheduled_day, No-show → no_show).
